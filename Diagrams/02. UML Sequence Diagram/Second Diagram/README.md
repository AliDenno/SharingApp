Review the code responsible for adding a new item.

Make a sequence diagram that captures the interactions of objects in the app when a new item is added.

Your sequence diagram should contain the following classes:

AddItemActivity

ItemList

Dimensions

Item

And contain calls of the following methods:

onCreate()

loadItems()

saveItem()

Dimensions constructor

Item constructor

addItem()

saveItems()

Lastly, the activation of AddItemActivity should start with the call to “onCreate()”

Hint: you may need to use nested activations.
