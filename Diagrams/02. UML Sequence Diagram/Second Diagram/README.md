Review the code responsible for adding a new item.

Make a sequence diagram that captures the interactions of objects in the app when a new item is added.

Your sequence diagram should contain the following classes:

AddItemActivity
ItemList
Dimensions
Item
And contain calls of the following methods:

onCreate()
loadItems()
saveItem()
Dimensions constructor
Item constructor
addItem()
saveItems()
Lastly, the activation of AddItemActivity should start with the call to “onCreate()”

Hint: you may need to use nested activations.
