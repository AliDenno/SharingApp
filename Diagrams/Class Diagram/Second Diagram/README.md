The owner may view all of their items, their “Available” items, or their “Borrowed” items.

The owner may change the status of an item they own from “Available” to “Borrowed” and back.

When an item’s status is changed to “Borrowed”, the owner must enter the username of the borrower.

These classes are:

* MainActivity
* SectionsPagerAdapter
* ItemsFragment
* AllItemsFragment
* AvailableItemsFragment
* BorrowedItemsFragment
* AddItemActivity
* EditItemActivity
* ItemList
* Item
* ItemAdapter
* Dimensions

The superclasses that the above classes inherit from are included. However, the methods and variables from these are not documented:

* AppCompatActivity
* FragmentPagerAdapter
* ArrayAdapter<Item>
* Fragment

Style guidelines for UML class diagram

* superclasses should be drawn above subclasses
* whole things should be drawn to the left of the part
* there should be few crossing edges
* boxes should not overlap other boxes or edges
* diagram should flow from top to bottom and left to right
